# Acquisition and Training Module (AcTrM)

Module of iTACS designed to automate image acquisition and user self-training in examining mechanical and chemical properties of adherent cells

## Todo list
* **Test:**  Allow an option of no bottom beads where xy and z recovery will be done using a small ROI within the frame.
* **Develop:**  Allow option of a second z recovery using top bead image instead of bottom beads
* **Develop:**  Have a provision for a non-uniform and progressively smaller dz in z-recovery. Check if this is already is not the case.
